Something is wrong with the world -- holes have been torn in the fabric of reality, allowing people to change things for better or worse.
You are NORT, one of the people who has learned to/has the ability to manipulate the worldâ€™s Source C0de (name drop).
It is your responsibility to venture deeper and deeper into the world, towards the cause of this disruption, while fixing reality along the way.
Fixing the Source C0de unlocks greater and greater abilities to make your life easier, but the puzzles also become more challenging.
Will you help NORT save the world and fix the Source C0de?
