        <h3>Introduction:</h3>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px">This document describes the game Source C0de; a 2D side scrolling puzzle game
            where the player is able to interact and change the in-game physics and input systems.
            These mechanics will allow players to solve puzzles in fun and interactive ways not
            possible in other 2D puzzle games.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Technology:</h3>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px">Source C0de is developed on the Phaser HTML and WebGL game framework.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Gameplay:</h3>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px">Source C0de is a 2D platformer with unique puzzle mechanics. The player moves from
            level to level with a page scrolling mechanic. Each level has a unique physics puzzle to
            solve which provides a challenge for the player whose goal is to get to the right side of
            the screen. Each level has pseudo code like statements which allow the player to
            interact with the mechanics of the game world. The player can manipulate the code
            blocks by hitting, picking up, and placing them in assigned locations to make completing
            the levels easier.<br>
            <br>
            First Level Idea: Player is shown code blocks to move forward and their keys. The
            player has the ability to fix the keys so they learn how to walk and also set the keys to
            WASD.<br>
            <br>
            Final Level Idea: Fighting the final boss (pictured below), the boss opens rifts which nort
            has to fix one after another. After you change “boss.armored” to false you will see the
            source code of the boss. Lastly, you will see “boss.isAlive == true” under the source
            code of the boss and changing it to false will end the game.<br>

        <h3>Objective:</h3>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px">Solve the puzzles. Save the system. Ride lightcycles. You are Nort. Win over the
            babes.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size:80%;">*lightcycles will not be in the first version of the game. Nort
            most definitely will.
            The babes are up to you.
        </p>
        <br>



        <h3>Story:</h3>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px">Something is wrong with the world -- holes have been torn in the fabric of reality,
            allowing people to change things for better or worse. You are Nort, one of the people
            who has learned to/has the ability to manipulate the world’s Source C0de (name drop).
            It is your responsibility to venture deeper and deeper into the world, towards the cause
            of this disruption, while fixing reality along the way. Fixing the Source C0de unlocks
            greater and greater abilities to make your life easier, but the puzzles also become more
            challenging. Will you help Nort save the world and fix the Source C0de?
        </p>

        <h2>Controls:</h2>

        <h3>Movement:</h3>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px">WASD will be used for movement and Space for jumping with various
            other key inputs for other actions. Most input keys will be user manipulatable
            allowing the user to swap keys for various actions to make beating a level easier.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Interaction:</h3>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px">The player will be able to interact with various aspects of the game world.
            The player will have the ability to hit, pick up, carry, and place various code block
            elements which will affect parts of the game world. By moving words or letters
            the player will manipulate how their character moves and how the game world acts.
        </p>

        <h3>Pause:</h3>

        <p style="margin-left: 40px">The “escape” key pauses the game!
